# 🧠 Think Tool

## 📖 Overview  
The **Think Tool** workflow demonstrates how to integrate a **Think Node** within an AI Agent setup. This allows you to define reasoning steps, establish behavior, and guide the AI’s decision-making process through carefully designed prompts.

## ⚙️ Workflow  
- A **prompt** is provided to the Think Node to establish the AI agent’s behavior.  
- The Think Node processes the reasoning before passing it forward in the workflow.  
- This approach enables more **structured, explainable, and controlled AI outputs**.
